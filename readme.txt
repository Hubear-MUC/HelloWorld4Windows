Hello World for Windows 1.0
---------------------------


The Windows- Version of the Hello World- Program.

Because I was not sure if it would work as expected despite being very small I did not want to include it in the "traditional" Hello- World- series published previously but give it another branch in versioning.

In fact this is the first Windows- program of mine going to public.

However it might stay the only one for some time because the implementation of a real window takes about 2 kbytes of code if it should include simple actions and the limit of code so far is at 180 bytes.

To use it just compile and run it.

It will show up with a small window (a message box) and close again if you click on the OK- button.
